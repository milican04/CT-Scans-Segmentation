    "The typical use of convolutional neural networks is on classification tasks, where the output of an image is a single class label. In the problem that we are considering, we definitely should classify CT scans, but we also need to locate abnormalities if they exist. To do that, it is necessary to assign a label to each pixel of the CT scan. Of course, we are going to have two labels: normal and abnormal. All pixels that are classified as abnormal, together construct the abnormality of the considering lungs."
